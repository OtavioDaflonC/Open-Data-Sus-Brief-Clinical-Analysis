# Open-Data-Sus-Brief-Clinical-Analysis
Data Sus data from 2018 on every center. Clinical data extracted by open datasets and analysed by regression models with simple and multivariate regression.

This analysis was used as MVP to attend 2021’s (First edition) edition of Health and Business Summit. Which work was presented on https://youtu.be/44lPuBBIp_M at first presentation.

Keep in mind data cleaning methods were applied by Excel before importing data as .csv. 
The Multivariate analysis associates data as labeled on the presentation.

Data updating wasn’t of concern to our team, since it runs only as a demonstration, which means Data Sus was a good source beside it’s updating issues now in 2021.
